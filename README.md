cheerio: Cheerio parses markup and provides an API for traversing/manipulating the resulting data structure. It does not interpret the result as a web browser does. Specifically, it does not produce a visual rendering, apply CSS, load external resources, or execute JavaScript. This makes Cheerio much, much faster than other solutions.

axios: Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
